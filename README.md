## Polyhedral Arena

This project was made for GMTK game jam #3 (I think). You are a contestant in the arena of dice, throwing explosives at your creepy, cubic foes. When you hit them, they go flying, and end up either dead or as a weaker tier of enemy. Survive as long as possible!

#### Controls
A controller is highly recommended. Use Left stick / WASD to move, right stick / left and right arrow keys to turn, and X button / space to attack. The longer you hold attack, the further you throw your explosive!
